Introduction
============

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.

To be able to deal with the elements of the gaming plateform at run-time, the graphic libraries and the games
must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at runtime.
Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared
library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main
program.

And the following games :
